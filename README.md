# iplotx
Plotting networks from igraph and networkx.

**NOTE**: This is currently pre-alpha quality software. The API and functionality will break constantly, so use at your own risk. That said, if you have things you would like to see improved, please open a GitHub issue.

## Goals
- Plot networks from igraph and networkx interchangeably, using matplotlib as a backend.
- Support interactive plotting, e.g. zooming and panning after the plot is created.
- Support storing the plot to disk thanks to the many matplotlib backends (SVG, PNG, PDF, etc.).
- Efficient plotting of large graphs using matplotlib's collection functionality.
- Support animations, e.g. showing the evolution of a network over time.
- Support uni- and bi-directional communication between graph object and plot object.
